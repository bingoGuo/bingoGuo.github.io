![Aragorn facing the mordor army](/images/aragorn-face-the-mordor-army.jpg)  
> **Aragorn II:** Hold your ground! Hold your ground. Sons of Gandor, of Rohan, my brothers. I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down. But it is not this day. This day we fight. By all that you hold dear on this good earth. I bid you stand, Men of the West!  
---- the Return of the King

![Sam encouraged Frodo when they were prison by Faramir](/images/sam-encourage-frodo.jpg)
>**Frodo:** I can't do this, Sam.  
**Sam:** I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't be here. But we are.  
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was, when so much bad had happened?  
But in the end, it's only a passing thing, the shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you, that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr.Frodo, I do understand. I know now.  
Folk in those stories, had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going, beacuse they were holding on to someting.  
**Frodo:** What are we holding on to, Sam?  
**Sam:** That there's some good in the world, Mr.Fordo. And it worth fighting for.  
---- The Two Towers

Go back to the shadow!  
You shall not pass!
